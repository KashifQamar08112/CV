<p> Student life begins when we take admissions in schools. There, we start studying different subjects, books and moral values. With time we also learn many skills, talents and life skills. Student life holds as crucial importance for a student as the foundation for a building. Student life involves fewer struggles, more fun, fewer problems, and more joy. Students do a lot of mischievous activities during their student life. But they also learn moral values that make them a gentleman providing them with a distinct identity in society. Your future totally depends on how has your student life been.</p>
